## Description
This is a dynamic read me generator. This can be used to quickly create a README from your terminal/console at the press of a node index.js! 

## Usage
This can be used for small and big projects. 

## Contributions
People can fork this if they would like to add their own custom touches or advance this simple mini app and request to merge with the mother/main repository. I am always looking to advance my own experience and am more than happy to see people update this.

## Installation
Go to the github link provided below. Clone the repository. Customize the index.js questions to your liking and run the program in your terminal. It is that easy!

## Questions
